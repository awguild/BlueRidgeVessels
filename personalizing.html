   	<h1>Personalizing the Urn</h1>
      <p>All of the urns made by Blue Ridge Vessels are hand-crafted and are custom-made for your pet.</p>
      <p>The urns are available in four sizes:</p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <td width="195"><p>Petite Keepsake - 2.5&quot;x2.5&quot;x2.5&quot;: up to&nbsp;10    lbs $85 </p></td>
          <td width="195"><p>Medium - 6.5&quot;x6.5&quot;x6.5&quot;: up to&nbsp;100 lbs    $269 </p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="195"><p>Small - 4.5&quot;x4.5&quot;x4.5&quot;:&nbsp; up to&nbsp;40 lbs    $140 </p></td>
          <td width="195"><p>Individual&nbsp;- 9&quot;x9&quot;x9&quot;: up to&nbsp;220 lbs    $415</p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
<h3>Personalize your pet's urn with a name and dates</h3>
<p>Make  your pet's urn even more unique by adding his or her name and dates to the urn.  Patti will carve your pet's personalization on the bottom of the urn. Choose&nbsp;this  personalization option below, if desired. If adding dates too, please type the  date range exactly as you would like it to be carved. For example just as  numbers&nbsp;6/24/99 - 5/30/10, as long dates June 24, 1999 - May 30, 2010, or  as abbreviated dates Jun. 24, 1999 - May 30, 2010. Due to space, only a name  can be carved on the Petite Keepsake Size. <strong>PLEASE  NOTE</strong>:  The nature of the hand made is that each piece is unique and will have slight  variations of color, surface and size. Each urn has itâ€™s own character and is  completely unique.</p>
<p>For  tips on using urns and storing ashes, please see our <a href="faq.html">Urns FAQs</a>.</p>
<p>Personalized  urns are non-refundable. All other urns can can be returned within five days  for a full refund. Please pack well, the customer is responsible for return  shipping and any damage that occurs in return shipping.</p>
