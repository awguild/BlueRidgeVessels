   	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p><strong>How do I determine what size urn would be best for my cremains?</strong><br />
      A  standard measure is to allow 1 cubic inch in the size of the urn per pound of  live weight.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you have any suggestions for how to best use an urn?</strong><br />
      Urns  can be used to store loose ashes, or they can be used to keep cremains in a  small bag. Urns are&nbsp; great for apartment dwellers who don't have a yard to  bury a pet in, for homeowners who know that they won't be in their home for a  long time, or for homeowners who are prohibited by county, state or association  rules to bury animals in their yards.</p>
      <p><strong>I'm concerned about the urn tipping over and the loose ashes spilling. Do your urns seal tightly?<br />
      </strong>The  urns don't generally seal tightly. The way that loose ashes are kept inside of  urns traditionally, is by sealing the urns shut permanently. This can be done  with an epoxy sealant that you can buy at any home improvement store, or with  Crazy Glue gel, not regular Crazy Glue, but specifically, the gel glue. The  other option is to put some of the cremains in a small sealable plastic bag and  place the bag inside of the urn. If  you don't want to permanently seal the urn shut, you can place the ashes first  into a sealable plastic bag and then store the plastic bag in a fabric <a href="http://peternity.com/products/category/21">Pet Cremains Bag</a>.</p>
