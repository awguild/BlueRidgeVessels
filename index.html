   	<h1>Home</h1>
      <p>Thank you for your interest in my art.  Pottery became an integral part of my life over 25 years ago. In the  early 1990s, I lived in the Appalachian mountains of southwest Virginia, working  with people who had lost a loved one unexpectedly. We carry one another’s  burdens in our hearts, so I looked for a way to process their loss and pain into  something that was rejuvenating. I began  studying pottery, and fellow classmates, teachers and east coast potters became  an extension of my family. Over the years I came to realize that the process of  building something with clay mirrors raising a child, or developing a relationship with a life long partner. The unruly clay demands the attention of my  mind and body, in an intention to center it and create something that becomes  filled with breath and energy. While cradling the clay, I have been able to  regularly traverse between inspiration and familiarity, passion and comfort.</p>

        This is the area where the story of the above pottery photograph will be told. The stories will change on different pages of your website (When there are enough). The photos will fit best if they are taller than they are wide.
